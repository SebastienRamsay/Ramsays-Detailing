This is a project that was a local buisness but is now waiting on funding to potentially go canada wide then "world wide". It started out as a local detailing buisness but later turned into an idea where the website connects contractors with home and vehicle owners. Contractors would be paid for their travel and an estimated $25 for every hour expected to complete the job. The customer would pay through the app and recieve before and after pictures for customer satisfaction and legal reasons. The application uses Stripe, Google OAuth and Google Maps API.
